# Travel_Information_Website

It takes information about the students that want to travel to a place together. It can be used by schools/ colleges to gather the students information that is willing to participate in the tour.

It currently uses HTML, and CSS,  for web designing. PHP is used to connect to the backend and take values from the user. MySql is used in the backend to store, organize and manipulate the data. XMAPP server is used.

This is my first PHP project and is currently ongoing. I have yet to use JS for information verification entered by the students.
